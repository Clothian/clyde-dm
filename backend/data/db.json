Flickering candlelight dances along the rough-hewn wooden walls, casting long shadows that seem to twitch like restless spirits. Outside, a cold wind rattles the stained glass windows, carrying faint echoes of a howling wolf pack somewhere in the dense forest beyond the town’s edge.\n\nYou're sitting alone at a scarred oak table when a burly figure clad in worn leather cloaks approaches, eyes gleaming with an urgent intensity. He slams a weather-beaten parchment before you. The wax seal—embossed with a hammer and anvil—is broken and curling at the edges.\n\n\"*Warlock,*\" he growls, voice hushed but firm, \"*this message came from the Forgeheart Clan. Their ancestral hammer has been stolen—a relic said to weigh more than a dwarf and burn hotter than dragon’s breath. Without it, their smithies go cold and their spirits wilt.*\"\n\nHe leans in closer, breath smelling faintly of mead and regret. \"*Rumor points to a cavern deep beneath the Forgotten Peaks. Shadowed and crawling with dangers. Will you answer the call to bring the hammer down?*\"\n\nThe parchment trembles slightly under your fingers, the weight of choice hanging thick in the smoky tavern air.\n\nWhat do you do?",

          "content": "A slow, reluctant sigh escapes your lips — the weight of obligation heavier than any hammer you've ever lifted. The burly man nods sharply, a trace of relief flickering across his rugged face.\n\n“*Good. The Forgotten Peaks aren’t kind to folk who wander unprepared. You'll need fire, steel, and a sharp mind.*” He reaches into his pouch, producing a crudely drawn map, its edges frayed and stained with smudges of soot. “*This will guide you through the caverns’ entrance. But legend warns, not all who enter return, and the darkness there... it’s hungry.*”\n\nThe tavern's door creaks open suddenly, a chill breeze swirling dust motes through the air. The gaunt shadows of dusk press against the gloom outside, a reminder that time is slipping away.\n\nYour fingers brush over the parchment once more — the Forgeheart Clan’s hoping eyes placed squarely on you by fate.\n\nShall you:\n\n1. Examine the map closely now to try to memorize the route or spot landmarks?\n\n2. Ask the burly man more about what kind of creatures or traps to expect?\n\n3. Prepare your gear and head out immediately into the creeping twilight?\n\nDecide, brave warlock. The forge’s fire waits for no one.",

The burly man gives you a curt, approving grunt, then fades back into the smoky crowd like a shadow at dusk.\n\nYou step out into the chill evening air, the first stars prickling the sky above. The Forgotten Peaks loom ahead— jagged, looming silhouettes etched against fading purple clouds.\n\nYour fingers check the familiar contours of your gear:\n\n- Your worn but sturdy cloak, layered for cold mountain gusts.\n\n- A coil of hempen rope slung across your shoulder, useful for scaling rocky ledges or crossing treacherous chasms.\n\n- Your arcane focus, humming softly with the latent power of your otherworldly patron.\n\n- A gleaming dagger at your belt, balanced and sharp.\n\n- A small pouch of rations snugly tied, a flask of water, and a flint ready to strike sparks.\n\nThe last embers of sunset retreat behind the peaks as you stride toward the winding trail that the map marks.\n\nThe path narrows swiftly, squeezing between ancient twisted pines heavy with moisture dripping from their needles. Somewhere far above, a raven calls—a harsh, jagged sound that cuts through the night.\n\nYour footsteps crunch on frost-hardened earth, the growing shadows folding around you like a cloak.\n\nAhead, the cavern’s yawning maw gapes black and patient, waiting.\n\nThe air grows colder here — damp and earthy, with a faint metallic tang of something old and powerful.\n\nWhat do you do next?\n\n- Light a torch to pierce the cavern’s shadows?\n\n- Peek inside first, eyes straining to catch movement or shapes?\n\n- Call out a challenge or greeting into the dark?\n\n- Or perhaps something completely unexpected?",
